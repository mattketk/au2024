# Generators in QM
## Momentum
- Generator of translation
- Translation operator $$\hat{T} \left( dx \right) = \hat{I} - i \hat{k} dx$$
	- $\hat{k}$ is a generator corresponding to momentum 
	- Obeys unitarity $\hat{T}^{\dagger}\hat{T}=\hat{I}$, $$\hat{T}^{\dagger}=\hat{I}+i\hat{k}dx \implies \hat{T}^{\dagger}\hat{T}= \left( \hat{I} + i\hat{k}dx \right) \left( \hat{I} - i\hat{k}dx \right) = \hat{I}\hat{I} + \hat{k}\hat{k}dx^2= \hat{I} $$ in the limit as $\lim_{ dx \to 0 }$.
- In a periodic space where $\left( x \in S', L^2(S') \right)$, momentum is discrete $$p=p_{n} = \frac{\hbar n}{l}$$ $l$ is the spatial period. If the momentum were continuous in this space, the wave function in this space would have discontinuities.
